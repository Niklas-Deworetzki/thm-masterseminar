PE is great technology to solve many problems.

Advantageous in Software Development.
General programs can be fast, speed-up.
Why not widespread, could tooling/compilcated use.


Not ripe in some areas.
Online is fast, but has termination problems.
Offline has less problems, but less speed up.
Generally speed-up is hard to predict/dependent on input.


Use as compiler is nice in theory, not really in practice.
Wont replace classical compiler construction.
Compilers are not created ``from nothing'', interpreters must exist and PEs too.
Target language is language from PE, for some tricks limited in language.
Compiler constructors would be needed in those fields, developing PEs.

Even existing PE and interpreter wont completely replace CC.
For optimizing compilers, as industry requires, clever people are needed.
PEs can't invent new data structures, can't invent mathematics, simplifications or dirty tricks.
PE only restructure input using known rules.
People are needed to implement or invent those rules,
people are needed to keep up to date, since technology is evolving.
