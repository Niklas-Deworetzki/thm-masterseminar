PE seems like great technology.

Software development, specialization can yield good results.
General programs, ``do all'' -> performant programs for specific use case.

Not widespread, bad tooling/complicated use.
Surely could improve existing software.
Even has some applications.

Use as compiler is nice in theory, not really in practice.
Wont replace classical compiler construction.
Compilers are not created ``from nothing'', interpreters must exist and PEs too.
Compiler constructors would be needed in those fields, developing PEs.

Even existing PE and interpreter wont completely replace CC.
For optimizing compilers, as industry requires, clever people are needed.
PEs can't invent new data structures, can't invent mathematics, simplifications or dirty tricks.
PE only restructure input using known rules.
People are needed to implement or invent those rules,
people are needed to keep up to date, since technology is evolving.
